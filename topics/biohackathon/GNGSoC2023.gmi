Making GN deployment rock solid

git repo genenetwork-machines, guix-bioinformatics

=> ../../issues/gnsoc-ci-rethink Tracking progress

### Week 1

* Proposal written
  - guix pull on guix-bioinformatics
  - updated guix is broken gemma (Pjotr)
* Efraim guix GN2 - so we can have a channel

  - once built they are shared
* And create a GN3 channel (Efraim?)
