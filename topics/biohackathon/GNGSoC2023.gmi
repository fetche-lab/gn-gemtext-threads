# GNSoC 2023

GN Summer of Code

## Introduction

We are running a GN Summer of Code in small teams.

* Runs July + August 2023
* Weekly plenary where projects present progress - Thursday 9am EU, 10 am EAT.
* Projects should be (slightly) out of comfort zone
* Use gemtext documentation
* Option for publishing on progress by then end as a BLOG or BioHackrXiv

## CI for guix-bioinformatics (guix pull)

* lead: Arun
* team: Efraim, Pjotr, Sarthak

Making GN deployment rock solid

git repo genenetwork-machines, guix-bioinformatics

=> ../../issues/gnsoc-ci-rethink Tracking progress

### Week 1

* Proposal written
  - guix pull on guix-bioinformatics
  - updated guix is broken gemma (Pjotr)
* Efraim guix GN2 - so we can have a channel
* Next step build substitutes for guix-bioinformatics
  - once built they are shared
* And create a GN3 channel (Efraim?)

### Week 2

* RISC-V port progressing with node and zig 0.10
* guix-bioinformatics now has CI!
* ~700 packages, 240 are broken ;)

### Week 3

* Arun gives a presentation on laminar using guix-forge: slides:
=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/ci-rethink-slides
* New system is simpler and has reproducibility issues
* Efraim is doing channels for GN2 and GN3
* Sarthak will try to run guix-forge

### Week 4

* Arun added channels to CI
* localhost
* cgit
* Efraim: gn2 -> channel; Arun tested

### Week 5

* Added Klaus server for git
* Fixed channels to work wit Python 3.9 instead of 3.10

### Week 6

* Towards a new workbench with cgit support

### Week 7

* Arun has cgit running on his own server - soon bringing up tux02 after resolving https

### Week 8

* cgit deployment at https://git.genenetwork.org/
* guix forge

### More

=> https://ci.genenetwork.org/jobs/guix-bioinformatics

* CI/CD is up and running again (and broken)
* Rethink: channels and pull channels are used for CI/CD
* Move unused packages elsewhere
