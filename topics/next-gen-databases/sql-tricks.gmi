# This document has some useful SQL tricks

* Check the character set/collation a given table uses:

```
SELECT CCSA.* FROM information_schema.`TABLES` T,
       information_schema.`COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY` CCSA
WHERE CCSA.collation_name = T.table_collation
  AND T.table_schema = "db_webqtl"
  AND T.table_name = "Investigators";
```
