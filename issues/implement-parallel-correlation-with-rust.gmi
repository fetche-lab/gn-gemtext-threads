# Implementing parallel correlation with rust

### Notes

In an attempt to speed the current gn2 correlation
we are doing an reimplentation in rust to support
parralel computation


## Tags

* assigned:alem,Fred
* type: upgrade
* priority: medium
* status: closed, completed
* keywords: correlation,rust,parralel


## Tasks

* [X] implementation of basic pearson and spearman correlation in rust

* [X] add unittests and benchmarks

* [X] loading datasets;format

* [X] package the library as a guix package


* [x]  gn2 integration

* [x] parsing input datasets

* [x]  benchmark for all datasets rust v gn2 version

* [ ] Figure out how to tell cargo to use the declared dependencies, rather than dowloading the dependencies

* [*] db queries migration to gn3 or use partial correlation queries

* [x] add parralel computation

* [x] code optimization and minor fixes

* [x] lmbd parser

* [x] implement biweight mid correlation for rust

* [] fix lmdb-rust packaging

* [] production deployment






## Notes

You can call the lib as an external process from any language or directly call
it in a rust cargo



code can be found here:

added a documentation for correlation rust

PR for integrating to genenetwork:

=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/93 



### 8 ,July 2022

worked on input data parsing and enhancements

PR for parsing datasets

=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/96


## 17,Aug 2022

integration of correlation rust ongoing with @fred working
also including optimizing of slow queries,code refatoring


## 5 Sept 2022

use text files similar to gn1 see example

=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork1/blob/d2381dd5bb35cb906032f7d530e9d14984e1de21/web/webqtl/correlation/CorrelationPage.py#L271

also something to be considered  is lmdb


## 20 Sept 2022

integrated  codebase to store db in text files for probeset types
=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/736



## 11 july 2022


* Parallel computation implementation with rust

* lmdb parser in rust

rather than parsing the code in python gn-correlation-rust can now read and parse
lmdb and csv  directly
