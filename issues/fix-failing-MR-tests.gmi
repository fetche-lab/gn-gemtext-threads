## Description
MR fails because of a python-flask/requests issue.  Everytime you issue a GET request to the server you get an empty response.  Here's an example using curl:

```
curl "http://localhost:5007/search?species=mouse&group=BXD&type=Hippocampus+mRNA&dataset=HC_M2_0606_P&search_terms_or=MEAN%3D%2815+16%29+LRS%3D%2823+46%29&search_terms_and=&FormID=searchResult"
```

And an example response:

```
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

Within the requests library, you get the following error:

```
raise ConnectionError(err, request=request)
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))
```
