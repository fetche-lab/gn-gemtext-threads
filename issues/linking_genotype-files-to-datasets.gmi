## Notes

A dataset can have multiple groups. In order to fetch all possible sample data fetch all possible groups in a dataset then use that to fetch all linked genofiles

As an example example the dataset HC_M2_0606_P is of type Probeset and linked groups for this dataset include (bxd,others) that would translate to these genofiles BXD.geno etc
