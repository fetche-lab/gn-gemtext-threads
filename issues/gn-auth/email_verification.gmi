## Description

When setting up e-mail verification, the following configurations should be set for gn-auth:

SMTP_HOST = "smtp.uthsc.edu"
SMTP_PORT = 25 (not 587, which is what we first tried)
SMTP_TIMEOUT = 200 # seconds

Not sure about username/password yet. We tried UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN and my own (Zach's) username/password
