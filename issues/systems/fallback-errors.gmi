## 502 timeout errors

These should no longer happen. It required relaxing timeouts on nginx and gunicorn.

## Rqtl2/HK/Pairscan not working

URL error on result of

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/gnu/store/a39cgbdawj9vp24nsz9q25sf9g5vda7c-profile/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 434, in prepare_url

  File "<string>", line 3, in raise_from
urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError: Failed to parse: http://localhost:8893api/rqtl/compute
```

The error points out a missing slash in the local URL: http://localhost:8893api/rqtl/compute

Grepping machines we get:

```
gn3-port 8893
("GN3_LOCAL_URL" ,(string-append "http://localhost:" (number->string gn3-port)))
```

On production we set a trailing slash

```
GN3_LOCAL_URL = "http://localhost:8081/"
```

and in the code we mostly see another addition of the slash - except for this particular link. Arguably the slash is not part of the URL prefix (it is part of the path), so I think setting GN3_LOCAL_URL without the trailing slash is preferred. See also

=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL

# R/qtl JSONDecodeError

After adding the slash to GN3 URLs (see above) led to the next error:

```
simplejson.errors.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

This looks similar to the earlier documented

=> ../rqtl-mapping-throws-JSONDecodeError

suggesting a missing path for R. In the container log GN3 actually gives the error

```
2024-03-24 08:02:24     return self.ensure_sync(self.view_functions[rule.endpoint])(**req.view_args)
2024-03-24 08:02:24   File "/gnu/store/yi76sybwqql4ky60yahv91z57srb2fr0-profile/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gn3/api/rqtl.py", line 25, in compute
2024-03-24 08:02:24     raise FileNotFoundError
2024-03-24 08:02:24 FileNotFoundError
```

Now two things are bad here becuase there is no context other than the error lines! For FileNotFound pass in the filename as suggested here:

=> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36077266/how-do-i-raise-a-filenotfounderror-properly

Patched in

=> https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/commit/b615df8c65d4fb6c8f08cf653e920c360c136552

That should help clarify the missing path or file.

```
  File "/export/source/fallback-debug/genenetwork3/gn3/fs_helpers.py", line 21, in assert_paths_exist
    raise FileNotFoundError(errno.ENOENT, os.strerror(errno.ENOENT), path)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/gn2/83f0831af5911ab6dc62cbbd37d13741.csv'
```

So, GN2 is miscommunicating the path to GN3.

This also led to documenting how one should test GN2 and GN3 in a running VM:
