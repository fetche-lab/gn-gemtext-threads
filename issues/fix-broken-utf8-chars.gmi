## Description

We have jumbled up text in our database and this has been the case for years.  It's impractical for a user to do the fixes using the metadata editing form because there are too many cases.  A script that fixes this should be created to fix this issue.

This thread has some really nice ideas

An example of a broken unicode character is: "ï¼ž".  The character "ï¼ž" appears broken because it is not a valid Unicode character. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a mistake when typing or pasting the character, corruption during transmission (most likely the case) or storage, or a lack of support for the character in the font or software being used to display the text.

To find the correct replacement for the character "ï¼ž", or any other character for the matter, you can look up its Unicode code point. In this case, the code point for "ï¼ž" is "U+2273", which corresponds to the character "≥". You can then use this code point to search for and replace the broken character with the correct character in the text.
