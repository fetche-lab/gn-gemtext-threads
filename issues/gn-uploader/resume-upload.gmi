## Description

If a user is uploading a particularly large file, we might need to provide a way for the user to resume their upload of the file.

Maybe this can wait until we have
=> /issues/gn-uploader/link-authentication-authorisation linked authentication/authorisation to gn-uploader.
In this way, each upload can be linked to a specific user.
